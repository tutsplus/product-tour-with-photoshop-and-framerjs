### Tuts+ Tutorial: Prototyping an Interactive iOS Product Tour with Framer.js
#### Instructor: Nick Bewley

Framer.js and its accompanying ecosystem Framer Studio are great tools for composing, presenting and iterating upon interaction design. In this post, I'll walk you through constructing an interactive prototype for a fictional iOS App's Product Tour through a Photoshop > Framer workflow. We'll assume that we are creating a news feed based app, in which updates from the user's network are displayed in a timeline, and whose settings and additional options are displayed in a sidebar.
